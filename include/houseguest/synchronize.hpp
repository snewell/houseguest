     * some resource (\a m) and invoke a callable object (\a fn).  Extra
     * arguments to \a fn can be passed as normal (they'll be picked up as
     * \a ts).
     *
     * If \a fn returns a value, it also be returned from this function.
     *
     * \tparam MUTEX Some lockable type.  This is used to create an
     *               std::lock_guard to handle the actual locking.
     * \tparam FN    A type that can be called like a function.
     * \tparam Ts    Any template arguments. These will only be used if extra
     *               arguments are passed to synchronize.
     *
     * \param m  Something that can be locked.  The lock will be held until
     *           \a fn completes.
     * \param fn A callable to invoke.
     * \param ts Extra arguments to pass to \a fn.  If \a ts is provided, it
     *        will be passed to \a fn using std::forward.
     *
     * \return The result of \a fn.

     * requires releasing a lock (e.g., waiting for a condition variable), but
     * is otherwise identical to synchronize.

     *               argument, but additional arguments can be passed.
     * \tparam Ts    Any extra template arguments.  These will only be used if
     *               additional arguments are passed.
     *
     * \param m  Something that can be locked using std::unique_lock.  After
     *           being aquired, the lock will be passed to \a fn as the first
     *           argument.
     * \param fn A callable to invoke.
     * \param ts Extra arguments to pass to \a fn.  If provided, they will be
     *           passed to \a fn via std::forward.
     *
     * \return The result of \a fn.
